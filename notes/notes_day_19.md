## II. E2E tests vs integration tests

E2E - tests the entire application, simulating real-world user scenarios from start to finish
Integration testing - focuses on verifying the interaction between integrated modules, components, or services.

## Run demo.html with node.js http server.  
Navigate where file is located and run this command:
```cmd
    <!-- run server without installing -->
    <!-- Might ask that need to install the following packages:
    http-server@14.1.1 -->

    npx http-server -p 8080

    <!-- run server before installing globally -->
    npm install -g http-server
    http-server -p 8080
```
Html file is accessible using `http://localhost:8080/`  
Ex.: http://localhost:8080/demo.html
