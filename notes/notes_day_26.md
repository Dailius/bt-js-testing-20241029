## I. Repeat and check homework

<br>

## II. Testing levels

1.  Unit testing
2.  Integration testing
3.  System testing
4.  UAT - user acceptance testing (E2E)
    1.  Alfa testing
    2.  Beta testing
  

E2E - This type of testing approach starts from the end user's perspective  and simulates a real-world scenario.

Mocking is a technique used in unit testing where dependencies of a module are replaced with fake implementations (mocks) to isolate the module being tested. This helps in testing the module independently without relying on external factors like databases, APIs, or actual services.

Why Use Mocking?  
✅ Isolation – Ensures we test only the unit in question, not external dependencies.  
✅ Speed – Avoids slow operations like database access or network calls.  
✅ Control – Lets us simulate different scenarios (e.g., errors, specific returns).  
✅ Reliability – Eliminates unpredictable behavior from real dependencies.
